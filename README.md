# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
The goal of this projects is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren't. This dataset is about 10,000 tweets that were labeled with 0 and 1.
